// Setup
let myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line
myStr = "Hello World"; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line

// String literals in JS are immutable meaning one cannot change individual characters in a string. In order to change the entire string one has to re-assign the variable a new string value.
